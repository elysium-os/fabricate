# Fabricate (Fab for short)

Fabricate is a meta buildsystem with the purpose of giving you (the programmer) as much control over the build process as possible. Fabricate uses lua as its configuration language and ninja as the backend.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found in the [docs/](./docs) directory and built with [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
