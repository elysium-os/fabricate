Fabricate Documentation
=======================

Fabricate is a meta buildsystem with the purpose of giving you (the programmer) as much control over the build process as possible.
Fabricate uses lua as its configuration language and ninja as the backend.
The source code can be found on `github <https://github.com/elysium-os/fabricate>`_ under the `ElysiumOS <https://github.com/elysium-os>`_ org.
